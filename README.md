## 2. FAQ

**Q: I got an error: Mageplaza_Core has been already defined**

A: Read solution [here](https://github.com/mageplaza/module-core/issues/3)

**Q: What image types are supported by Image Optimizer?**

A: Most common image types are supported, including PNG, JPG, and GIF. 

**Q: Can you please let me know about the optimization process?**

A: At first, all files (of the directories that are included) will be scanned. After that, the scanned images will be optimized. 

**Q: Is it possible to set up the optimization process to be automated by a specific schedule?**

A: Yes, it is absolutely possible. With the help of cron, the schedule to scan and optimize the image can be set on a regular basis. 

**Q: How is the quality of the image after optimizing?**

A: Using Magento 2 Image Optimizer, you will have two options, which are Lossless and Custom. Choosing Lossless, you can reduce the size of the image while still retaining the quality of that image. On the contrary, you can define the quality percent of optimized images with the Custom option. However, please keep in mind that small file size equal with worse image quality.

## 4. Highlight Features of Magento 2 Image Optimizer

### Optimize multiple types of images

![Optimize multiple types of images](https://i.imgur.com/xXd6u8v.png)

With [Magento 2 Image Optimizer](https://marketplace.magento.com/mageplaza-module-image-optimizer.html), various types of images such as PNG, JPG, and GIF can be compressed easily by the store admins. These three image types are the most common formats which are used by thousands of online stores to upload the pictures of their products and services. With compressed image size, you will be able to better your store siteâ€™s performance. 

### Control image quality: lossless or lossy

![Control image quality](https://i.imgur.com/7u4MUJz.png)

Setting the compression level is the most interesting feature of the Magento 2 Image Optimizer extension. There are two compression options which create different image quality and file size output that you can use: Lossless and Lossy. 

On the one hand, Lossless is an option which allows admin to retain the quantity of image while downsizing its size. More specifically, by removing unnecessary meta data from image files, the file size will be decreased marginally.

On the other hand, Custom compression, also known as Lossy, will help you to reduce the file size dramatically. However, there will be a loss in the data of the original image file; in other words, the quality of the image will be affected. When Magento 2 Image Optimizer extension is applied to your store, the retained proportion of quality after the compression process can be set without a visible loss in image quality. As a result, you can retain full control of image quality as well as the compression level. 

### Process optimization automatically

![Process optimization automatically](https://i.imgur.com/0x8mQiF.png)

You can activate the image compression on a regular basis by running cron. Thanks to this, the admin will no longer need to compress images manually. 

Magento 2 Image Optimizer will scan all the available images and notify you about the optimization status. After that, this module will activate the optimization process to scan than compress images in certain times. Store admins will be able to save a great amount of time with this automated operation. 

### Back up original images

![Back up original images](https://i.imgur.com/ikmN1Rs.png)

To ensure the safety of original images, modifications should accompany with backup. With Magento 2 Image Optimizer, all images will be stored in an image directory, and store admins can roll-back any image and use it at any time if necessary. 

The backup feature allows admins to freely modify the image without worrying about the original picture being lost. 

### Included and excluded images directories

![Included and excluded images directories](https://i.imgur.com/RL7plM0.png)

In addition, you can also assign the image scan to certain directories of your site. From the admin backend, admins can include all directories which have the images being scanned and exclude ones which you would like to keep images from scanning. 

Thanks to this separation, the scanning process will become much more time-saving and focussing. The directories which require original pictures with full quality will not be counted in the optimization process.
